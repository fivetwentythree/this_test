i think this idea is not worth my time - so I am not going to do this

here is my plan its a fuzzy idea and i dont even know the terms i need to ask this question
so the plan is like this

- i will have the 10 best articles from the ecnomist that day in the morning
- i need to rewrite those stories in the way Bloomberg's Matt Levine writes
- they should have all the characteristics of the writer and should have clarity too
- if you feel like there are some techinical jargon and feel like some ideas go way back or have some kind of unique
  provenence they should be outlined
- everything should be in finely arranged no willy nilly
- i think i will use gemini 2.5 pro for the writing task
- i think of using github actions for some part of this process but i couldnt really put my finger on this idea, if you can help that would be great
- the final presentation i dont have any idea help me here too
